# Description

Customer churn, also known as attrition, occurs when a customer stops doing business with a company. Understanding and detecting churn is the first step to retaining these customers and improving the company's offerings. IBM created a dataset for a fictional telecommunication company which can be downloaded here. Conveniently, the dataset contains a column churn to determine whether the customer has churned.

For this problem, our goal is to build a model to predict a customer's likelihood of churn and provide recommendations on how Telco can reduce churn.
